# libsql-stateless-easy

> Thin libSQL stateless HTTP driver for TypeScript and JavaScript for the edge but easy ðŸš€
- âœ… **Supported runtime environments:** Web API (browser, serverless), Bun, Node.js (>=18)
- âœ… **Is extremely light:** 38.8kB (unpacked)/  10.9kB (package)/ 10.2KB (minified)/ 3.7KB (minified+gzipped)
- âœ… **Is built for:** Quick stateless query execution. (Mainly for serverless and edge functions.)
- âœ… Supports everything in `@libsql/client/web` **except `interactive transactions`.
- âœ… Unlike `@libsql/client/web`, **every function performs complete execution in exactly 1 roundtrip.**
- âœ… **`libsql-stateless-easy` is simply a drop-in replacement** and exactly same API as `@libsql/client/web`.

# Installation
```sh
$ npm i libsql-stateless-easy #pnpm, yarn, etc.
# or
$ bun add libsql-stateless-easy
```

# Client Usage
`libsql-stateless-easy`'s `client` has the exact same API as [`@libsql/client/web`](https://docs.turso.tech/libsql/client-access/javascript-typescript-sdk#create-a-database-client-object-for-local-and-remote-access)'s `client`.
```ts
    import { createClient } from "libsql-stateless-easy";
    //or
    const { createClient } = require("libsql-stateless-easy");

    const client = createClient({
        url: "https://da-fish-mandible.turso.io",
        authToken: "fksdgfgksdgfksdg.javsdKDGKSBkgsdfg289374dg"
    });
    
    const res = await client.batch([
        {
            sql: "select * from contacts where contact_id = ?;",
            args: [3]
        },
        "select first_name, last_name, email from contacts where contact_id = 2",
        {
            sql: "insert into contacts (contact_id,first_name,last_name,email,phone) values (?,?,?,?,?);",
            args: [6,"glomm","feru","moca@doro.co","001"]
        },
        {
            sql: "delete from contacts where contact_id = :kkl",
            args: {kkl: 6}
        }
    ]);
    console.log(res);

    const res2 = await client.execute({
        sql: "select first_name, last_name, email, contact_id from contacts where contact_id = ?;",
        args: [1]
    });
    console.log(res2);

    const res3 = await client.serverOk();
    if (res3) console.log("Server Compat Check OK");
    else console.error("Server Compat Check NOT OK");
```

# Drizzle (and other ORMs)
**`libsql-stateless-easy`'s `client` works with drizzle (and other ORMs) out-of-the-box.**
This library implements the same Interface is the official client and therefore works with all the ORMs that the official client works with.
```ts
    import { createClient } from "libsql-stateless-easy";
    import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/libsql';

    const client = createClient({
        url: "https://da-fish-mandible.turso.io",
        authToken: "fksdgfgksdgfksdg.javsdKDGKSBkgsdfg289374dg"
    });

    const db = drizzle(client);

    const result = await db.select().from(table_name).all();
    console.log(result);
```

- **This library has the exact `LibsqlError` API as `@libsql/client`**

## Performance
This library checks your configs, environments and server compatibality by default.
Hoever this is _kinda_ resource intensive if you're creating client instances often.
So, **IF YOU ARE SURE YOUR CONFIGURATION, ENVIRONMENT AND SERVER VERSION ARE CORRECT, PLEASE DISABLE THE CHECKS FOR EVEN BETTER PERFORMANCE.**
```ts
    const client = createClient({
        url: "https://da-fish-mandible.turso.io",
        authToken: "fksdgfgksdgfksdg.javsdKDGKSBkgsdfg289374dg",
        criticalChecks: false
    });
```

### List of other stuff in this library
Feel free to explore them (however you dont need to as they've been neatly packaged into the `client`)
```ts
import {
    libsqlValueBuilder, libsqlStatementBuilder, libsqlBatchReqStepsBuilder, libsqlBatchReqStepExecCondBuilder, libsqlTransactionBeginStatement,
    libsqlValueParser, libsqlStatementResParser, libsqlBatchStreamResParser, libsqlTransactionBatchStreamResParser,
    libsqlExecute, //has easier API than `libsql-stateless`'s function of the same name
    libsqlBatch, //has easier API than `libsql-stateless`'s function of the same name
    libsqlServerCompatCheck, //has easier API than `libsql-stateless`'s function of the same name,
    libsqlBatchTransaction, libsqlExecuteMultiple
    createClient //used above
} from "libsql-stateless-easy";
```
