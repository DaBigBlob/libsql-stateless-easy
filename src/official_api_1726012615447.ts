 * server cannot process multiple write transactions concurrently, so if there is another write transaction
 * already started, our transaction will wait in a queue before it can begin.
 *
 * - `"read"` is a read-only transaction, started with `BEGIN TRANSACTION READONLY` (a libSQL extension). This
 * transaction mode supports only reads (`SELECT`) and will not accept write statements. The libSQL server can
 * handle multiple read transactions at the same time, so we don't need to wait for other transactions to
 * complete. A read-only transaction can also be executed on a local replica, so it provides lower latency.
 *
 * - `"deferred"` is a transaction started with `BEGIN DEFERRED`, which starts as a read transaction, but the
 * first write statement will try to upgrade it to a write transaction. However, this upgrade may fail if
 * there already is a write transaction executing on the server, so you should be ready to handle these
 * failures.
 *
 * If your transaction includes only read statements, `"read"` is always preferred over `"deferred"` or
 * `"write"`, because `"read"` transactions can be executed more efficiently and don't block other
 * transactions.
 *
 * If your transaction includes both read and write statements, you should be using the `"write"` mode most of
 * the time. Use the `"deferred"` mode only if you prefer to fail the write transaction instead of waiting for
 * the previous write transactions to complete.
